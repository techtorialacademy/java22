# Boolean Data Type
- The boolean data type is a primitive type that can store two possible values: `true` or `false`. 
This data type typically used for decision-making in programs, such as checking conditions and 
controlling the flow of code. 
#### Usage of Boolean Type
* Boolean variables are often used to represent the outcome of logical conditions.
* To create a boolean variable: 
```java
boolean isEmpty = false;
boolean canPass = true;
```
# Comparison Operators 
- Comparison operators are used to compare two values. These comparisons yield a boolean
result (`true` or `false`). The result of the comparison can be stored in a boolean variable
or used directly in conditional statements(if,loops).

|   Operator          | Symbol | Description                            | Example   | Result |
|---------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| Equal To            | `==`   | Checks if two values are equal         | `4 == 4`  | true   |
| Not Equal To        | `!=`   | Checks if two values are not equal     | `4 != 4`  | false  |
| Greater than        | `>`    | Checks if the left value is greater    | `11 > 7`  | true   |
| Less than           | `<`    | Checks if the left value is smaller    | `7 < 11`  | true   |
| Greater or equal    | `>=`   | Checks if the left is greater or equal | `14 >= 14`| true   |
| Less or equal       | `<=`   | Checks if the left is smaller or equal | `21 <= 30`| true   |
